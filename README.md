#DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

🚀 Welcome to #B-hook: Your Gateway to Creative Expression! 📚✨

Bhook proposed a new interactive way to create a book or other content creation (videos, music, art etc..). You can write a book chapter by chapter and get feedbacks from your community. This allow you to introduce your work to other people, and get funds while writing your books.

📝 When publishing a new chapter the author have the possibility to show a public preview of the chapter. If a user want to get access to the full chapter, he can register as a reviewer and the author can in another step grant him access to the full chapter. Then, the user can read the full chapter, create a feedback and share it with the author. Finally, the author can see the review of the reader, and gives a score to it.

🔒 Tech-Savvy Publishing: Each Book & chapter will be represented as an NFT. We are using Oasis allowing us to have public and private NFT information. On the public side, we will have the public preview that anyone can see. And, we will have the private text representing the full chapter that only the approved reviewer or sponsor can see.

🤝 Bandada Integration: Harness the power of community by creating specialized groups and extending invitations to specific communities via a simple link. This tailored approach seamlessly connects you with niche audiences.

#BOUNTIES

=> OASIS
Github implementation link
We utilized Oasis to enable creators to share both a public and a private segment of their creation. Once users are validated by the creator and possess a specific NFT, they gain access to the private portion of the creation.
The best part is that we implement the Oasis Gasless feature to provide a seamless experience, allowing reviewers to leave feedback without paying anything.

=> BANDADA
Github implementation link
We employ Bandada to enable content creators to invite users using a uniquely generated Bandada link. Guests can access a portion of the creator's content for free through this link.
